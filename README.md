# Creating Live Graphs

This programme uses **matplotlib.animation** to repeatedly update and show a graph as its data source is updated.

My script, **'anim.py'** uses a bespoke function to read data from a .csv file into a dataframe. This data is then handled to prepare it to be graphed.

In order to model a live data source, I created the script, **'data.py'**, which produces two lines to be plotted.
